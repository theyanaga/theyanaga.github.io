After many months thinking about whether I should start doing something like this or not, I've finally decided to commit and start this blog.

I've always wanted to do this more consistently, but I was running into a lot of problems - the biggest of which was the fact that I cannot, for the life of me, make HTML and CSS work. However, for some reason, this past weekend, I got inspired to work on this website and make it look presentable. It's far from being an amazing personal website, but I think that it does the job: getting my words out into the world. 

Now, with regards to what sparked this motivation, I have [Foojay's amazing blog post featuring Sebastian Daschner][seb-blog-post] to thank for that. In this wondeful blog post, Sebastian gives us his opinion on how to best learn and truly understand a topic - his sheer depth of knowledge is amazing and his passion for learning and sharing is also contagiating. 

With that being said, I noticed I was doing a rather poor job of learning (mostly keeping what I've learned) and sharing my knowedge with others. I hope to use this website, as a way to document the things that I've learned. As I move through this scary journey that is a Computer Science career, I will be writing down what I learn in little blog posts in the hopes of solidifying my own understanding but also sharing the answers to the questions that other fellow CS enthusiasts might have. 

Hope that you find this hopeful :)
