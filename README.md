# Personal Website

This website was made with Jekyll. 

## Running

Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to run the server on `localhost:4000`

Run `bundle exec jekyll build` to create the static pages for deployment

## Editing

Edit content on the markdown files of the root directory to change information

Also look at the `_layouts` directory for the HTML theme.

### CSS

Edit the `_sass/main.scss` file.

### Adding a new page

If you would like to add a new page, you can create a new layout in `_layouts`, then add the navigation settigns to the `_data/navigation` directory.

The page itself just lives on the home directory .i.e. `about.markdown`.

### Adding a new post

If you would like to add a new post, just add a new file under `_posts`, make sure to follow the same format as the others.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

Just push to `main` and it should show up there.
